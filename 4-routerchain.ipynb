      "1. **Feature Overview**: The ETL tool should allow users to filter rows based on advanced filter expressions.\n",
      "2. **User Needs**: Users need the ability to define complex filtering criteria to refine the data being processed.\n",
      "3. **Technical Considerations**: The tool must handle various data types and support logical operators, comparison operators, and possibly functions within the filter expressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Questions to Fill in Gaps\n",
      "1. **What types of data sources will the ETL tool support for filtering?**\n",
      "2. **What specific advanced filter expressions are expected? (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, etc.)**\n",
      "3. **Are there any limitations on the complexity of the filter expressions?**\n",
      "4. **How will users input these filter expressions? (e.g., GUI, code, etc.)**\n",
      "5. **What should happen if the filter expression results in no data?**\n",
      "6. **Are there any performance considerations when applying these filters?**\n",

      "    Given the user has access to the ETL tool\n",
      "    When the user inputs a filter expression that matches no rows\n",
      "    Then the ETL tool should return an empty dataset\n",
      "    And the user should be notified that no data matches the filter criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "  Scenario: User saves an advanced filter expression for future use\n",
      "    Given the user has access to the ETL tool\n",
      "    When the user creates and saves an advanced filter expression\n",
      "    Then the filter expression should be stored in the user's profile\n",

      "  Scenario: User applies a complex filter expression\n",
      "    Given the user has access to the ETL tool\n",
      "    When the user inputs a complex filter expression using multiple logical operators\n",
      "    Then the ETL tool should correctly interpret and apply the expression\n",

      "### Test Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Test Types**:\n",
      "   - **Functional Testing**: Verify that the application behaves as expected according to the acceptance criteria.\n",
      "   - **Usability Testing**: Assess the user interface and experience to ensure it is intuitive and user-friendly.\n",
      "   - **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the system's performance under various load conditions, especially with large datasets.\n",
      "   - **Security Testing**: Ensure that user inputs are validated and that the system is secure against injection attacks.\n",
      "   - **Compatibility Testing**: Check the tool's functionality across different browsers and devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Test Levels**:\n",
      "   - **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components of the filtering logic.\n",
      "   - **Integration Testing**: Ensure that the filtering feature integrates well with other components of the ETL tool.\n",
      "   - **System Testing**: Test the complete system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Test Environment**:\n",
      "   - Set up a staging environment that mirrors production, including a variety of datasets (small, medium, large) and user profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Test Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Test Cases Derived from Acceptance Criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Valid Filter Expression**:\n",
      "   - Input: A valid filter expression (e.g., `age > 30`)\n",
      "   - Expected Result: Rows matching the criteria are returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Invalid Filter Expression**:\n",
      "   - Input: An invalid filter expression (e.g., `age >`)\n",
      "   - Expected Result: An error message is displayed, and no filtering occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **No Data Matches**:\n",
      "   - Input: A filter expression that matches no rows (e.g., `age < 0`)\n",
      "   - Expected Result: An empty dataset is returned, and the user is notified.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Save Filter Expression**:\n",
      "   - Input: A valid filter expression to save.\n",
      "   - Expected Result: The expression is saved and can be retrieved later.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Complex Filter Expression**:\n",
      "   - Input: A complex filter expression (e.g., `age > 30 AND (city = 'New York' OR city = 'Los Angeles')`)\n",
      "   - Expected Result: Correct rows are returned based on the complex criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Performance with Large Datasets**:\n",
      "   - Input: A valid filter expression on a large dataset (e.g., 1 million rows).\n",
      "   - Expected Result: The filtering process completes within an acceptable time frame (e.g., < 5 seconds).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Additional Test Cases (Not Covered in Acceptance Criteria)\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Edge Cases for Filter Expressions**:\n",
      "   - Input: Filter expressions with special characters (e.g., `name LIKE '%John%'`)\n",
      "   - Input: Filter expressions with null values (e.g., `age IS NULL`)\n",
      "   - Input: Filter expressions with extreme values (e.g., `age > 100`)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Usability Testing**:\n",
      "   - Verify that the filter input field provides suggestions or autocomplete for valid expressions.\n",
      "   - Check if the error messages are user-friendly and provide guidance on correcting the input.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Security Testing**:\n",
      "   - Input: SQL injection attempts (e.g., `1; DROP TABLE users;`)\n",
      "   - Expected Result: The system should sanitize inputs and not execute harmful commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Concurrent Users**:\n",
      "   - Simulate multiple users applying filters simultaneously to check for race conditions or performance degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Filter Expression Length**:\n",
      "   - Input: Extremely long filter expressions (e.g., > 1000 characters).\n",
      "   - Expected Result: The system should handle long inputs gracefully without crashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Data Type Handling**:\n",
      "   - Input: Filter expressions with mismatched data types (e.g., `age = 'thirty'`)\n",
      "   - Expected Result: The system should handle type mismatches appropriately and return an error.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Localization and Internationalization**:\n",
      "   - Test the filtering feature with different locale settings to ensure that it handles various date formats, currency symbols, and language translations correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:\n",
      "   - Verify if users can undo or redo their filter actions and that the system maintains the correct state.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This test strategy and plan provide a comprehensive approach to validating the \"Advanced Row Filtering\" feature in the ETL tool.

    "   - Expected Result: Rows matching the criteria are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invalid Filter Expression**:\n",
    "   - Input: An invalid filter expression (e.g., `age >`)\n",
    "   - Expected Result: An error message is displayed, and no filtering occurs.\n",

    "   - Input: A valid filter expression to save.\n",
    "   - Expected Result: The expression is saved and can be retrieved later.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Complex Filter Expression**:\n",
    "   - Input: A complex filter expression (e.g., `age > 30 AND (city = 'New York' OR city = 'Los Angeles')`)\n",
    "   - Expected Result: Correct rows are returned based on the complex criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Performance with Large Datasets**:\n",
    "   - Input: A valid filter expression on a large dataset (e.g., 1 million rows).\n",
    "   - Expected Result: The filtering process completes within an acceptable time frame (e.g., < 5 seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Test Cases (Not Covered in Acceptance Criteria)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edge Cases for Filter Expressions**:\n",
    "   - Input: Filter expressions with special characters (e.g., `name LIKE '%John%'`)\n",
    "   - Input: Filter expressions with null values (e.g., `age IS NULL`)\n",
    "   - Input: Filter expressions with extreme values (e.g., `age > 100`)\n",

    "   - Input: SQL injection attempts (e.g., `1; DROP TABLE users;`)\n",
    "   - Expected Result: The system should sanitize inputs and not execute harmful commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concurrent Users**:\n",
    "   - Simulate multiple users applying filters simultaneously to check for race conditions or performance degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Filter Expression Length**:\n",
    "   - Input: Extremely long filter expressions (e.g., > 1000 characters).\n",
    "   - Expected Result: The system should handle long inputs gracefully without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Type Handling**:\n",
    "   - Input: Filter expressions with mismatched data types (e.g., `age = 'thirty'`)\n",
    "   - Expected Result: The system should handle type mismatches appropriately and return an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Localization and Internationalization**:\n",
    "   - Test the filtering feature with different locale settings to ensure that it handles various date formats, currency symbols, and language translations correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Undo/Redo Functionality**:\n",
